This repository contains examples of Dockerfiles. Dockerfiles are used to generate Docker images, which are stateless snapshots of running environments for tools, known as 'containers'. Docker images are used to port tools together with their environments, so that the tools can be run (in their containers) on diverse infrastructure.

In particular, you can use Docker images to port your own bioinformatics tools to Seven Bridges' cloud Platform and Cancer Genomics Cloud.

To learn how to use Dockerfiles to generate Docker images, take a look at the Seven Bridges documentation for

[The Seven Bridges Platform](http://docs.sevenbridges.com/docs/upload-your-docker-image-with-a-dockerfile), or
[The Cancer Genomics Cloud](http://docs.cancergenomicscloud.org/docs/upload-your-docker-image-with-a-dockerfile)

To get familiar with the Dockerfile syntax, we also recommend looking at examples. You are welcome to contribute your own Dockerfiles here to support the community.
